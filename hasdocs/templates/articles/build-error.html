    <p>
      Build can fail for many reasons. The following are the most common cases
      for build failure.
    </p>
    </p>
    <h3>Documentation or requirements path</h3>
    <p>
      For Sphinx projects, <code>docs</code> is the most common path for documentation.
      For pip, optional <code>requirements.txt</code> is the common filename for
      dependencies. Many Jekyll projects have the current directory <code>.</code>
      as the docs path.
    </p>    
    <h3>Modules with C extensions</h3>
    <p>
      It is also possible that your project has some modules with C
      extensions. Most libraries for web applications are available at build
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a shared library need for a module, however, isn't available, please
      contact us at <a href="mailto:support@hasdocs.com">support@hasdocs.com</a>
      for help.
    </p>
    <h3>Absolute binary path</h3>
    <p>
      If you specify an absolute path (/User/foo/bin/sphinx-build, for example) for
      a binary file in Makefile or other scripts, build may fail after failing to
      locate the binary on the build system.
    </p>

    </h2>
    <p>
      You can see the output from build at <code>www.hasdocs.com/owner/project/logs/</code>.

    </h2>
    <h3>Sphinx</h3>
    <p>
      For Sphinx docs, a virtualenv is created. All the dependencies are
      installed by running <code>python setup.py</code> or
      <code>pip -r requirements.txt</code> if a requirement file is specified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the docs are built by running
      <code>make html</code> in the docs directory specified for the project.
    </p>
    <p>
      We use Sphinx version 1.1.3.
    </p>
    <h3>Jekyll</h3>
    <p>
      Jekyll docs are built by running <code>jekyll --pygments --no-lsi --safe</code>
      in the docs directory specified for the project.  
    </p>
    <p>
      We use version 0.12.0 for Jekyll and 2.4.1 for Liquid. It also supports
      Pygments and RedCloth.
    </p>
    <h3>Javadoc</h3>
    <p>
      Java docs are built by running
      <code>find . -name *.java > file.lst && javadoc -d html @file.lst</code>.
    </p>
